# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

#AI Tools Required: 
ChatGPT / OpenAI API (Core engine for prompt interaction)

Prompt Engineering Techniques (Role prompting, structured prompts, parameterized prompts)

# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.

1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are capable of understanding natural language and generating human-like responses, making them ideal for creating personalized productivity applications.

A prompt-based approach allows developers or users to leverage AI without deep coding, relying instead on carefully constructed instructions (prompts) to guide the model’s outputs.

Key Advantages:

Adaptability: Can handle diverse tasks without extensive retraining.

Creativity: Generates solutions or suggestions that might not be obvious.

Efficiency: Automates repetitive task management processes.

2. Core Requirements of the Assistant
Feature	Description	Benefit
Daily Task Manager	Accept tasks, organize by priority/deadline, summarize	Reduces manual tracking, ensures timely completion
Smart Scheduler	Schedule events, detect conflicts, suggest free slots	Efficient time management, prevents overlaps
Wellness Tips Generator	Suggest hydration, exercise, screen breaks, sleep reminders	Supports mental and physical well-being
General Query Handler	Answer daily questions about tasks or schedules	Acts as an all-in-one assistant
Adaptive Memory (Optional)	Track user preferences for personalized advice	Improves over time, offers tailored suggestions
3. Prompt Design Strategy

Prompt design is the heart of a prompt-based application. The same assistant can behave very differently depending on how prompts are written. Here’s a progression:

A. Zero-Shot Prompting

Purpose: Quick, direct instructions.

Example: “Remind me to drink water at 3 PM.”

Output: AI returns a simple reminder.

Limitation: May not handle complex reasoning or prioritize tasks.

B. Few-Shot Prompting

Purpose: Provides examples so the model learns the pattern.

Example:

“Example 1: Schedule 3 tasks across 6 hours. Example 2: Schedule 5 tasks across 10 hours. Now schedule 4 tasks across 8 hours.”

Output: Structured, consistent task plan.

Benefit: Higher accuracy and reliability.

C. Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT)

Purpose: AI reasons step-by-step before answering.

Example: “I have 6 tasks with deadlines. Plan them by urgency and available time, thinking step-by-step.”

Output: Sequential daily plan that accounts for task priorities.

Benefit: Reduces mistakes in complex scheduling or sequencing.

D. Persona Prompting

Purpose: AI assumes a role (coach, mentor, expert).

Example: “You are a productivity coach. Suggest my day to balance study, work, and wellness.”

Output: Holistic daily plan with advice.

Benefit: More human-like and context-aware responses.

E. Multimodal / Advanced Prompting

Purpose: Handles structured or mixed input/output formats.

Example: “Create a travel itinerary in table format based on my preferences.”

Output: Table with detailed schedule and suggestions.

Benefit: Useful for tasks that need structure, visualization, or multi-step reasoning.

4. Practical Simulation

Step 1: Task Input

User inputs tasks naturally:

“I need to finish Math homework, call mom, and exercise today.”

Step 2: AI Response Using Few-Shot Prompting

Daily Schedule:
9:00 AM - 10:30 AM: Math homework
11:00 AM - 11:30 AM: Call mom
5:00 PM - 6:00 PM: Exercise


Step 3: Adaptive Feedback

User indicates exercise should be earlier.

AI updates schedule:

9:00 AM - 10:00 AM: Exercise
10:30 AM - 12:00 PM: Math homework
12:30 PM - 1:00 PM: Call mom


Step 4: Wellness Suggestions

AI suggests: “Take a 5-minute stretch break every hour of study” or “Drink water after exercise.”

5. Learning Outcomes

From this exercise, users learn:

Prompt Engineering Skills: Crafting prompts to guide AI output effectively.

Task Management Insights: Translating real-world needs into AI-compatible instructions.

Creativity: Designing new features, adapting suggestions to personal routines.

Problem-Solving: Simulating complex scenarios (e.g., task prioritization, time conflicts).

Understanding AI Limitations: Recognizing when AI might misinterpret vague instructions and how to refine prompts.

6. Potential Enhancements

Memory Integration: Keep track of recurring tasks and preferences.

Voice Interface: Use speech-to-text to add tasks by voice.

Notifications / Alerts: Integrate with calendar apps or mobile notifications.

Analytics: Generate weekly reports on task completion or productivity trends.

Gamification: Encourage user engagement through points or streaks for completed tasks.

7. Conclusion

The lab exercise demonstrates that prompt-based applications can transform LLMs into practical personal assistants. By progressively refining prompts—from simple instructions to few-shot, chain-of-thought, and persona prompts—users can build AI tools that are creative, adaptive, and highly useful in daily life.

The exercise fosters hands-on skills in AI interaction, problem-solving, and practical application development, showing how LLMs can bridge the gap between raw AI capabilities and real-world utility.

# Result: 
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language models. Students were able to:
 Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.
 Foster creativity by designing features suited to their personal or academic lives.
 Learn prompt engineering techniques for optimal interaction with AI tools.
 Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
